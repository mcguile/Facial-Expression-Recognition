# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Jupyter Notebooks containing most code used in my undergraduate dissertation: Deep Learning for Facial Expression Recognition and the Effect of Occlusions in Images

Configurations trialled are labelled alphabetically, the final configuration, I, being the strongest, yielding 68.2% on FER2013.

Below is a table displaying the configurations.

Code is provided to apply occlusions to FER2013 in CSV format, and other databases using train/test image directory format.

Network weights could not be provided due to file size limitations on GitHub - contact me if you would like a H5 file containing the weights.
