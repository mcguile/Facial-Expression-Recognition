# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Jupyter Notebooks containing all code used in my undergraduate dissertation: Deep Learning for Facial Expression Recognition and the Effect of Occlusions in Images

Configurations trialled are labelled alphabetically, the final configuration, I, being the strongest, yielding 68.2% on FER2013.

Below is a table displaying the configurations.
